# Interactive component

Interactive graphs are visually attractive and can grab a lot of attention. It can be useful to summarize huge data with complex numbers and can assist with data forecasting. The quality of life for various ethnic groups was plotted as an interactive graph. The count for each quality of life in the stacked bar can be found by hovering over the graph. The project's goal is to evaluate Austin, Texas's quality of life and the plot depicts the same. The graph shows that a significant portion of people across all ethnic groups believe their quality of life is good. Chinese and Asian Indian respondents make up the majority of survey participants. Chinese people make up the majority of respondents in the poor category, whereas Asian Indians make up the majority of respondents in the excellent category.
